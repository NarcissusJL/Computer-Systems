# Description

This repository contains a C++ library for working with graphs. It includes the following files:

- `graph.cpp`: Implementation file for the Graph class.
- `graph.h`: Header file for the Graph class.
- `test_graph.cpp`: Test file for testing the functionality of the Graph class.
- `vertex.cpp`: Implementation file for the Vertex class.
- `vertex.h`: Header file for the Vertex class.



#The algorithm works as follows:

### File: graph.cpp

This file contains the implementation of the Graph class. It includes the member function definitions and helper functions used by the Graph class.

### File: graph.h

This header file defines the Graph class. It includes the class declaration, member function prototypes, and private member variables of the Graph class.

## Vertex Class

The `Vertex` class represents a vertex in a graph. It includes functions for comparing vertices based on their weights.

### File: vertex.cpp

This file contains the implementation of the Vertex class. It includes the member function definitions and operator overloading for vertex comparisons.

### File: vertex.h

This header file defines the Vertex class. It includes the class declaration, member function prototypes, and private member variables of the Vertex class.

## Test File

The `test_graph.cpp` file is used for testing the functionality of the Graph class. It includes test cases for the depth-first search, cycle detection, and Prim's algorithm operations.
